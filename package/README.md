Clean Armenian is a script that runs through a string and replaces any armenian curse word
written in Armenian, Cyrillic or Latin alphabet with one of three random emojis.
```
var Censor = require ("clean-armenian")

```
The name of the function can be anything you want.
The string to be censored or the variable with it goes in the parentheses after the function name.
For example:UserInput = Censor(UserInput)
